                <br />
                Toxicology shows Carbamazepine was found in his system. This is not unexpected as Byers was prescribed Ritalin for ADHD.

                and lips. There were superficial bite marks on both cheeks. There were multiple fractures on the base of
                the skull. There were abrasions on the neck but no fractures or hemorrhages.
                <br />
                <strong>Anal and Genital Injuries:</strong> The anus was dilated and there was inflammation in the rectal and
                anal mucosa. The skin of the penis, scrotal sack and testes were missing. There was a yellow contusion
                with skin slippage and a gaping wound cause by multiple puncturing and gouging injuries. The left
                buttocks had 5 superficial cutting wounds. The right buttocks had multiple linear interrupted cuts. There
                were abrasions present on the anus.
                <br />
                <strong>Internal Examination:</strong> There were no abnormal fluids in the internal cavities. There was no
                evidence of blunt force or puncture trauma to the internal organs. There was some vomit in the upper
                and lower airways, but no water.
                <br />
                No semen was found orally or rectally.

                <strong>Head injuries:</strong> Multiple abrasions on both eyes, the mouth, the left ear, and the mandible. There
                was hemorrhaging in the gums and mucosal membranes. There was a Â¼ in laceration at the superior
                medial margin. The entire left side of the face suffered from abrasions and irregular gouging type cuts.
                Many of these cuts punctured through the left cheek into the oral cavity. There were fractures at the
                base of the skull.
                <br />
                <strong>Terminal Submersion:</strong> There was pulmonary edema and congestion with bloody frothy fluid in
