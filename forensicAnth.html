            <h2>Forensic Anthropology</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;Forensic anthropology could be very helpful in finally solving the murders of Branch, Moore, and
                Byers. The only forensic anthropologist to work on the case is Dr. Werner Spitz. He came to the
                conclusion that the wounds on Byers’ genitalia were caused by wildlife.
                <br />
                &emsp;The police have been criticized for their handling of the crime scene, especially for moving the
                bodies before the coroner could arrive. Dr. Spitz claims that staining on the inside of Byers’ cranium
                could indicate a different resting position upon death.
                <br />
                &emsp;The inclusion of a forensic anthrolopogist on the scene when the bodies were found would help ensure that evidence was properly collected and catalogued.
                Due to their background in archeology, forensic anthrolopogists are uniquely qualified to investigate outdoor crime scenes. They could ensure that the bodies were not moved and perform a thorough sweep of the area to find any evidence left at the scene.
