            <h2>The West Memphis 3</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;The three sentenced for this crime were Damien Echols (18), Jessie Misskelley Jr. (17), and Jason
                Baldwin (16). Baldwin and Echols were close friends, and while they knew Misskelley, they were not
                friends with him. All three held similar tastes in music and pop culture and were known to disdain the
                bible belt culture of West Memphis. Evidence against them was brought by Vicki Hutchenson, who said that she met Echols at a Wiccan ritual and that he claimed he killed three boys. Her son Aaron claimed that he and the three victims saw five men singing songs to the devil and "doing what men and ladies do." This statement was leaked by the police to the press, but Aaron was unable to keep his story straight or pick Echols, Misskelley, and Baldwin out of a lineup. He later claimed to have seen the murders occur, but was proven to be in his trailer home at the time they occured. The indictment of the “West Memphis 3” is attributed to the
                “Satanic Panic”, a fear of occult and satanic rituals that swept the nation in the late 80’s and early 90’s.
                In 2011 the three entered Alford pleas, meaning that they acknowledged the evidence against them but
                upheld their innocence. They were released on time served.

            <h2>Additional suspects</h2>
            <h3>Chris Morgan and Brian Holland</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;Chris Morgan and Brian Holland were West Memphis teenagers that were early suspects in the case.
                Both had previous drug offences and had left for California abruptly, 4 days after the bodies were
                discovered. A warrant was put out for their arrest in California where they took polygraphs. The
                polygraphs indicated deception but was later barred as evidence. The police did not continue to
                investigate Morgan and Holland as suspects following their arrest in California.
            </p>
            <h3>"Mr. Bojangles"</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;“Mr. Bojangles” is the name given to a black man seen at a Bojangles about a mile from the
                crime scene. The employees of the Bojangles claimed he was mentally disordered and distraught and he
                entered the ladies bathroom and left blood on the walls. The police took blood scrapings from the walls
                but these were later claimed to have been lost.
