            <h2>The Long Island Serial Killer</h2>
            <p>On the South Shore of Long Island, New York, bodies have been appearing from 1982 to 2013. 10 to 16 possible victims have been identified, and although it is possible the cases are unrelated there are connections between the M.O.s and signatures. On this site you will find a timeline of events concerning this case, a list of victims both identified and not, a list of suspects and persons of interest, and a breakdown of how the field of forensic anthropology can be applied to this ongoing investigation.</p>
