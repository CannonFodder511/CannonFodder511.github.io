            <h2>The West Memphis 3</h2>
            <p>&emsp;Steve Branch, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers were three eight year old boys who were
                reported missing on May 5th 1993 by Byers adoptive father. They were last seen at 6:30 that night by
                neighbors when Branch’s stepfather called them home. That night there were searches conducted by
                the police and by the neighbors, both of which turned up nothing.

                &emsp;The next morning at 8am police organized a second search for the missing children, including a
                shoulder to shoulder search of Robin Hood Hills, the neighborhood where the boys were last seen. No
                sign of the children were found. Around 1:45pm of the same day, the children were found in a small
                creek that drained to Robin Hood Hills.

                &emsp;Initial investigations showed that the boys had been stripped naked and hogtied. The clothing
                was recovered from the same creek bed wrapped inside out around sticks thrust into the mud. Two
                pairs of the children’s underwear were not found. There was trace amounts of semen on one pair of
                pants at the scene. Christopher Byers was the only one who suffered lacerations. Police claim that the
                boys were likely assaulted and killed at the creek, but due to the lack of blood at the scene, critics claim
                the children were unlikely to have been assaulted at the creek.
